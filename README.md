# KeyPointDetector

One common basic approach to match in images is to detect suitable keypoints, which are spatial points that describe
interesting and stand out information in the image. Many applications can benefit from keypoint detection in occurrence
the keypoint detection in terrestrial laser scans for registration and texture mapping. Meanwhile, the challenge is to find
accurate points that are invariant to any kind of distortions, less susceptible to noise and relevant for further image
analysis tasks. Therefore, we need an approach to fulfil these requirements in order to get optimal interest points. A way
to obtain the above distinctive points is to use keypoint detection algorithm such as FÃ¶rstner operator, which consists to
find the optimal points within the optimal window. We obtain successful results to the normal and tangent features
while struggling with others.
